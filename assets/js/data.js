    shortDesc: "One teammate writes instructions; the other builds the object from those instructions.",
    overview: "One team member writes a set of instructions for assembling a provided object. Their partner, in a separate room, then attempts to recreate the object using only those written instructions. Score is based on how closely the final build matches the original.",
    rules: [
      "2 participants with separate roles: the Writer and the Doer.",
      "Writer has a set time (typically 25 minutes) to write instructions for the object assembly.",
      "Doer has a set time (typically 25 minutes) to reconstruct the object from the written instructions only.",
      "No diagrams, drawings, or symbols may be used — instructions must be purely text-based.",
      "Score based on the number of correctly placed and oriented components.",
      "No communication between Writer and Doer once the event begins."
    ],
    tips: "<strong>Develop a consistent, precise vocabulary system before the event.</strong> Use numbered pieces and a coordinate system for positions. Practice writing and following instructions for many complex objects. Time your writing — you have to describe everything completely within the time limit. After practicing, swap roles and critique each other's instructions.",
